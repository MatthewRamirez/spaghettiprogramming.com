Simple blog application that I wrote for learning, testing out new things, and fun.  It has some useful features:

* Admin login through Google OAuth
* Attach images to blog posts which are auto resized for you using the excellent paperclip gem.
* Attach any other type of files to a blog post, also courtesy of paperclip.
* You can specify a permalink / slug for nice looking urls or it will auto generate one based on title of blog post.
* Can have non public blog posts for articles you are working on, or just don't want people to see.
* Can use markdown in blog posts which will get rendered and formatted nicely.
